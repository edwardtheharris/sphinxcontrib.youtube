# sphinxcontrib.yt package

There are really just the two modules, one of which is {file}`__init__.py`.

## Submodules

This first one has most of the code in it.

### sphinxcontrib.yt.youtube module

```{eval-rst}
.. automodule:: sphinxcontrib.yt.youtube
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
```

This is the {file}`__init__.py` that was mentioned earlier.

### Module contents

```{eval-rst}
.. automodule:: sphinxcontrib.yt
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
```
